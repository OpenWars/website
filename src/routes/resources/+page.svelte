		<p>Hi! This is the place planned to have all resources for making maps, mods and so.</p>
		<!--- Total lie: -->
		<p>But for now, we have planned to implement functionality for maps.</p>
		<!---
      At my defense, what I'm supposed to implement? A public list of mods, sprites?
      Many lawsuits incoming.
      I also want to avoid authentication and those things, I mean there isn't a single good authentication library for Svelte.
      There is @authjs but it's too green to be used, i have plans of using a API key instead.

			We could do it right now, but someone <!--- Yes Rivest, it's you --> refuses to make my map format!
